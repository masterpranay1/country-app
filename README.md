## Tools Used

- React

## FEATURES ðŸ‘‡

### Country Api

[Rest Country Api](https://restcountries.com) is used to fetch all the data.
Fetching is done in **three** ways:-
1. All the data with limited options.
2. Data of a particular country by name.
3. Data of a list of countries by their codes.

    `React Hooks` are used to mount the data after calling them. And updating only if needed.

### Multi Page Routing

There are `two` main pages in this application.
1. Homepage
2. Details Page
    This Detail page is dynamic ( passing country name as `url` as `parameter`) and display the detail of the country user wish to view.
